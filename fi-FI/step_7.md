## Mark where you click

At the moment, the marker appears when you click the map, but it always appears in the same place. Remember the code we already added in the last step to listen for the map being clicked:

```javascript
zombie_map.addListener('click', function(e) {
  place_marker();
});
```

Did you notice the `function(e)` part? The `e` stands for **event**, and clicking on the map is an event. The event records the longitude and latitude of the location that was clicked, and we can access that information like this:

```javascript
var location = e.latLng;
```

+ Add this line of code to find the location inside your listener code, so that the code now looks like this:

```javascript
zombie_map.addListener('click', function(e) {
  var location = e.latLng;
  place_marker();
});
```

We need to pass the location data to the `place_marker` function so that it can be used to position the marker. An item of data passed into a function is called an **argument**.

+ Add `location` as an **argument** to the `place_marker()` function. Arguments go inside the brackets. Your code should now look like this:

```javascript
place_marker(location);
```

+ Now find where you define the `place_marker()` function. This is the line of code which begins `function place_marker()`. Add `location` inside the brackets here, like this:

```javascript
function place_marker(location){
    var marker = new google.maps.Marker({
      position: {lat: 52.206727, lng: 0.124450 },
      map: zombie_map
    });
}
```

+ Finally, instead of putting the marker at the specific latitude and longitude, we want to put it at the `location` that was clicked on. Change one more thing inside your `place_marker()` function to put the marker at the clicked location, rather than always on Cambridge, UK.

Which part of the code contains the fixed position of the marker that is always placed on Cambridge, UK?

What is the name of the variable containing the location data we passed to the `place_marker()` function as an argument?

Replace the fixed latitude and longitude (the part beginning and ending with braces `{ }`) with the name of the variable containing the longitude and latitude of the clicked location.

Here is how your finished code should look:

```javascript
var marker = new google.maps.Marker({
  position: location,
  map: zombie_map
});
```
