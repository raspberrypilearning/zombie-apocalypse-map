## Challenge: prepare for zombies

+ Change the map so it is centered on your local area instead of on Cambridge, UK
+ Add your own points of interest to the zombie map
+ Copy and paste your location data from the console log into a text fileâ€”be careful to remove any other data that might have been included, such as file names and line numbers. We can then use this saved information to create [Where's Zombie?](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/wheres-zombie), a GPS zombie map game
