## Choose your icon

Rather than always having a red marker, it would be good to be able to place emojis on the map to show different points of interest. Perhaps you might want to mark a hospital where you could find refuge from the zombies, a weapons cache to help you fight them off, or even the location of the zombies themselves!

To do this, you will need some emojis. You could draw your own emojis if you are feeling creative, or there are plenty to choose from on [Wikimedia commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Emoji). Save your emojis as 32px x 32px PNG files for best results.

Here are the emojis we will use in this guide, but you can use as many different emojis as you like. ![Hospital](images/hospital.png) ![Weapons](images/weapons.png) ![Zombie](images/zombie.png)

+ Decide on the emojis you will use and save the PNG image files into the same folder as your `index.html` file. Make sure the file names of your emoji pictures do not contain any spaces.

+ Locate the line of code `<div id="zombie_map"></div>`. On a blank line immediately below it, add in the HTML tags to begin and end a form:

```html
<form>
</form>
```

+ Between the `<form>` tags, add a `<select>` element. This creates a drop-down menu from which you can select an emoji.

```html
Select an emoji
<select id="icon_to_use">
  <option value="zombie.png">Zombie</option>
  <option value="hospital.png">Hospital</option>
</select>
```

+ Save the file and refresh your internet browser. You should see a drop-down menu with two options - zombie or hospital.

+ Add options to your `<select>` tag for every emoji you have chosen to use. Save and check that all of the options appear properly in your menu.

For each emoji, add another line that looks like this: `<option value="hospital.png">Hospital</option>`

--- /hint ---

Make sure that you set the correct file name of each emoji picture as the `value` in the option, and that each emoji picture is saved in the same folder as your `index.html` page.

+ Now let's tell the map to display the chosen emoji instead of the red marker when we click the map. Here is a line of code which will get the currently selected emoji.

```javascript
var emoji = document.getElementById('***').value;
```

To tell the code from where to get the data, you need to replace `'***'` with the `'id'` specified in the `<select>` element.

Add this line of code here: ![Add your code here](images/add-code-here.png)

+ Finally, add a comma at the end of the line `map: zombie_map`, then add the line `icon: emoji` below it. Doing so will set whichever emoji was selected from the drop down menu as the marker. ![All the icons](images/zombies-oh-my.png)
